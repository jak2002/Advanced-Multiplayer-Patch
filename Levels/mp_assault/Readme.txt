Map Description:

Primarily, I created this map to be as fun as possible with no exceptions. 

This map was created to exploit the hang gliders as much as possible. 
There are also Boats and Buggies, but the focus is Hang Gliders.
Its a Pretty big map, which means lots of room to fly around. 
4 Islands surround the main Island, all with weapons and various pick-ups. 
Floating structers with pick-ups and hang gliders on them which you can fly to and snipe from. 
Unique water style which is not found in ANY of the levels shipped with the game, nor any user created maps I have seen.
