Northern Treepack v2
--------------------

This pack of trees contains 5 spruces and 5 pines for use in northern maps. They can be used with the bending property and all kinds of shadows outdoors. Each one is a little different and having a separate texture. Alpha blending is generating stray lines around the texture, so avoid that in this version.

To install, just extract the files in the zip to any folder inside the FarCry installation, preferrably in your map folder. In Sandbox select the cgf files from there when choosing vegetation model, just as the builtin ones. Best is to use all 5 in one group when painting to make it look more non-uniform and realistic.

Feel free to use the content of this pack in any FarCry freeware map, or modify them. Just mention me as the author of the originals in your readme file when releasing your map.
