Description (incl. attack tips)
-----------
Context
A recently deserted island by the government with many unique land 
formations that play to the players
advantage/disadvantage depending on your style of play!

Flag 1 -
Located just over the hill from the attackers spawn inside a heavy fort.  
Jeeps are located just up the
hill beyond a buildable bridge.

Flag 2 - King of the Hill!
A desert style flag upon a huge hill with many unique walls to infiltrate.

Flag 3 -
Located up a hill as well with access at the corners.  Beware no 
walls/fences to keep players from plunging to their deaths,
so skill is required when fighting.
