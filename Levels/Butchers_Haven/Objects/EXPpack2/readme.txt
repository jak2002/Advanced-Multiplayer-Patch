Entity Xpansion Pack
--------------------
version 2.0 beta
by Aarbro - aarbro@hotmail.com

EXP is a pack of new entites for use by mappers in Far Cry. They are primarily made for use in SP maps. Many can probably be used in MP maps too but it's untested so far. You can use them for free in any map or mod provided it's released for free and I get credit for it.

For documentation see the included PDF.

==================================================================================================
IMPORTANT!
----------
EXP now REQUIRES DCL 1.2 or later!

The installation procedure has now changed as DCL is required for EXP. This means that previous MOD and PAK versions should be removed. As long as the correct version of DCL is installed you can now use EXP in any version of FarCry in both Devmode and Normal mode.

Also note that previous modded entities (ChainSwing, SoundSpot, Binoculars & Sights) have been removed from the EXP. These will be a separate download to not interfere with EXP installation that from now on will only contain completely new material.
==================================================================================================

Installation:
============

1. Install DCL 1.2 or later. DCL_v12.zip is included in this package, see docs inside there for installation help. Ensure that you install for the correct version of FarCry you use.

2. Copy the exp20.pak to the FCData folder in your Far Cry folder. Remove any previous version (ScriptsEXP.pak).

3. Make sure you have a MyAddons folder directly under Far Cry installation. If not, create one with that name there. Copy exp20.dcl to the MyAddons folder.
